Here's a code sample: 1 2 # Let me re-iterate ... for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) } As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like: 1 2 3 define foobar() { print \"Welcome to flavor country!\"; } (which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it: 1 2 3 4 5 6 import time # Quick, count to ten! for i in range ( 10 ): # (but not *too* quick) time . sleep ( 0.5 ) print ( i ) An h3 header \u00b6 Now a nested list: First, get these ingredients: * carrots * celery * lentils Boil some water.

Here's a \"line block\" (note how whitespace is honored): | Line one | Line too | Line tree and images can be specified like so: Inline math equation: $\\omega = d\\phi / dt$.
